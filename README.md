lemu
====

An emulator launcher, super simple, very very easy to setup, for mouse users.

Made with node-webkit (therefore dependent on it) in my very own Super Simple Web IDE (as are all my projects of late).

Saves config in localStorage, so each new machine instalation requires reconfiguration.

Very simple, easy to configure.

Configs in app. No messing with config files.

To compile it, just zip everything to a file called lemu.nw. Or follow node-webkit instructions on its github 
page. The script lemu.nw does that.

Download:

Linux/mac version does not include node-webkit. Have it installed. Windows users with node-webkit installed may 
download from the linux/mac link, since it is universal.
